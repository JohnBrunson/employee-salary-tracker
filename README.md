# Employee Salary Tracker

## Description
I decided I wanted to push myself a little bit and start working on a challenge I received early. I wanted to see how far I could push my skills and ignore the starter code... instead, let's build everything from scratch. HTML, CSS, the Javascript especially. Yeah... initial draft kinda works, but there's a more elegant way of doing this.

I'm only a couple functions in, but there's some definite progress. I think I'm learning how I DON'T want to build things, but the iteration process is important. Some time ago, a python programmer encouraged something to the effect of getting the code down, get it working... then you worry about beautifying it. So, that's what I'm trying to do. Get something down that meets a certain set of requirements.

This is a bit of a stub I'll probably revisit with a more proper readme later.
